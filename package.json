  "description": "The Flutter Client is a mobile app for the [JVx framework](https://doc.sibvisions.com/jvx). It's super generic and renders work-screens dynamically. The app supports all layout features of JVx and comes with a default menu and login mechanism. It's designed as standalone app and also as library. This means that you can easily extend the library and create your own app.",
